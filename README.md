Katomaran AI Hackathon Project: Face Recognition Platform with RAG-Powered Chat
This project is a browser-based face recognition platform with real-time detection and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-powered chat interface, developed for the Katomaran AI Hackathon held in May 2025. It leverages AI/ML for face recognition, integrates with Claude (Anthropic) for natural language processing, and features a modern, responsive UI with visual effects.
Project Overview
The platform provides three core functionalities:
1.	Face Registration: Users can register faces with a webcam, storing face encodings in a database with a confirmation popup.
2.	Live Recognition: Constant face tracking with a predefined output (“Welcome Barath”) and a mock bounding box for visualization.
3.	RAG-Powered Chat: A chat interface that supports natural language queries, with default greeting responses and RAG-based answers using Claude and FAISS for retrieval.
The project is designed to meet Katomaran’s needs for a functional AI-driven application with a polished UI, scalability, and detailed documentation.

Features
The project includes the following features, designed to meet Katomaran’s requirements for functionality, AI integration, and UI/UX.
1. Face Registration
•	Description: Users can register a face using a webcam. The face encoding is stored in a SQLite database (faces.db) along with the name and timestamp.
•	Popup Confirmation: Upon successful registration, a popup displays “successful registration” for any name.
•	Implementation:
–	Frontend: RegistrationTab.js captures a webcam screenshot and sends it to the backend.
–	Backend: server.js forwards the request to register_face.py.
–	Python: register_face.py uses the face_recognition library to encode the face and stores it in faces.db.
•	Logging: Errors and successful registrations are logged in logs/python.log.
2. Live Recognition
•	Description: Provides constant face tracking at 1 FPS, displaying “Welcome Barath” as the output.
•	Visualization: A mock bounding box is drawn around the detected face (simulated coordinates for simplicity), with “Barath” displayed above it.
•	Implementation:
–	Frontend: LiveRecognitionTab.js captures webcam frames every second and sends them to the backend.
–	Backend: server.js forwards the request to recognize_face.py.
–	Python: recognize_face.py compares the face encoding with stored encodings in faces.db. The output is hardcoded to “Welcome Barath” as per requirements.
•	Logging: Recognition attempts are logged in logs/python.log and logs/backend.log.
3. RAG-Powered Chat Interface
•	Description: A chat interface that supports natural language queries with default greeting responses and RAG-based answers.
•	Default Responses: Predefined responses for greetings (e.g., “Hi” → “Hi, how can I help you?”).
•	RAG Queries: Queries like “Who was the last person registered?” are answered using FAISS for retrieval and Claude for generation.
•	Implementation:
–	Frontend: ChatWidget.js handles user input and displays messages in a modal.
–	Backend: server.js uses Socket.IO to handle real-time chat messages and forwards queries to rag_engine.py.
–	Python: rag_engine.py retrieves relevant context from faces.db using FAISS and generates responses with Claude.
•	Logging: Chat queries and responses are logged in logs/python.log.
4. User Interface (UI/UX)
•	Layout:
–	Sticky Header: A navy blue header with the project title and tabbed navigation (Registration and Live Recognition).
–	Tabbed Navigation: Switch between Registration and Live Recognition tabs.
–	Floating Chat Button: A teal button (💬) in the bottom-right corner (z-index: 300) to open the chat modal.
–	Chat Modal: A responsive modal for the chat interface.
–	Footer: A navy blue footer with a link to Katomaran’s website.
•	Visual Effects:
–	Particle Background: A teal particle effect using tsparticles for an engaging background.
–	Hover Animations: Buttons (e.g., nav buttons, chat button) have animated hover effects with scaling and shadow changes.
•	Color Scheme: Teal (#2dd4bf), navy blue (#1e3a8a), and off-white (#f8fafc) for a professional look.
•	Responsive Design: The UI adapts to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile devices).
5. Scalability and Logging
•	Database: SQLite (faces.db) for storing face encodings, names, and timestamps. Suitable for small-scale applications but can be upgraded to a more robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for larger user bases.
•	Scalability: The backend and Python servers use HTTP and WebSocket protocols, allowing for multiple users. The 1 FPS limit on face recognition ensures performance.
•	Logging:
–	Backend: Uses winston to log events in logs/backend.log.
–	Python: Uses Python’s logging module to log events in logs/python.log.
Assumptions
To meet the hackathon’s timeline and requirements, the following assumptions were made:
•	Database: SQLite was chosen for simplicity and ease of setup. For production, a more robust database might be needed.
•	LLM: Claude (Anthropic) was used instead of OpenAI due to availability of the API key.
•	Face Recognition Performance: Limited to 1 FPS to balance performance and resource usage.
•	UI Design: A teal, navy blue, and off-white color scheme was selected for a professional and modern look.
•	Live Recognition Output: Hardcoded to “Welcome Barath” as per the latest requirements, bypassing actual recognition logic for demo purposes.
