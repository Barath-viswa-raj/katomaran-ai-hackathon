Katomaran AI Hackathon Project: Face Recognition Platform with RAG-Powered Chat
This project is a browser-based face recognition platform with real-time detection and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-powered chat interface, developed for the Katomaran AI Hackathon held in May 2025. It leverages AI/ML for face recognition, integrates with Claude (Anthropic) for natural language processing, and features a modern, responsive UI with visual effects.
Project Overview
The platform provides three core functionalities:
1.	Face Registration: Users can register faces with a webcam, storing face encodings in a database with a confirmation popup.
2.	Live Recognition: Constant face tracking with a predefined output (‚ÄúWelcome Barath‚Äù) and a mock bounding box for visualization.
3.	RAG-Powered Chat: A chat interface that supports natural language queries, with default greeting responses and RAG-based answers using Claude and FAISS for retrieval.
The project is designed to meet Katomaran‚Äôs needs for a functional AI-driven application with a polished UI, scalability, and detailed documentation.

Features
The project includes the following features, designed to meet Katomaran‚Äôs requirements for functionality, AI integration, and UI/UX.
1. Face Registration
‚Ä¢	Description: Users can register a face using a webcam. The face encoding is stored in a SQLite database (faces.db) along with the name and timestamp.
‚Ä¢	Popup Confirmation: Upon successful registration, a popup displays ‚Äúsuccessful registration‚Äù for any name.
‚Ä¢	Implementation:
‚Äì	Frontend: RegistrationTab.js captures a webcam screenshot and sends it to the backend.
‚Äì	Backend: server.js forwards the request to register_face.py.
‚Äì	Python: register_face.py uses the face_recognition library to encode the face and stores it in faces.db.
‚Ä¢	Logging: Errors and successful registrations are logged in logs/python.log.
2. Live Recognition
‚Ä¢	Description: Provides constant face tracking at 1 FPS, displaying ‚ÄúWelcome Barath‚Äù as the output.
‚Ä¢	Visualization: A mock bounding box is drawn around the detected face (simulated coordinates for simplicity), with ‚ÄúBarath‚Äù displayed above it.
‚Ä¢	Implementation:
‚Äì	Frontend: LiveRecognitionTab.js captures webcam frames every second and sends them to the backend.
‚Äì	Backend: server.js forwards the request to recognize_face.py.
‚Äì	Python: recognize_face.py compares the face encoding with stored encodings in faces.db. The output is hardcoded to ‚ÄúWelcome Barath‚Äù as per requirements.
‚Ä¢	Logging: Recognition attempts are logged in logs/python.log and logs/backend.log.
3. RAG-Powered Chat Interface
‚Ä¢	Description: A chat interface that supports natural language queries with default greeting responses and RAG-based answers.
‚Ä¢	Default Responses: Predefined responses for greetings (e.g., ‚ÄúHi‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúHi, how can I help you?‚Äù).
‚Ä¢	RAG Queries: Queries like ‚ÄúWho was the last person registered?‚Äù are answered using FAISS for retrieval and Claude for generation.
‚Ä¢	Implementation:
‚Äì	Frontend: ChatWidget.js handles user input and displays messages in a modal.
‚Äì	Backend: server.js uses Socket.IO to handle real-time chat messages and forwards queries to rag_engine.py.
‚Äì	Python: rag_engine.py retrieves relevant context from faces.db using FAISS and generates responses with Claude.
‚Ä¢	Logging: Chat queries and responses are logged in logs/python.log.
4. User Interface (UI/UX)
‚Ä¢	Layout:
‚Äì	Sticky Header: A navy blue header with the project title and tabbed navigation (Registration and Live Recognition).
‚Äì	Tabbed Navigation: Switch between Registration and Live Recognition tabs.
‚Äì	Floating Chat Button: A teal button (üí¨) in the bottom-right corner (z-index: 300) to open the chat modal.
‚Äì	Chat Modal: A responsive modal for the chat interface.
‚Äì	Footer: A navy blue footer with a link to Katomaran‚Äôs website.
‚Ä¢	Visual Effects:
‚Äì	Particle Background: A teal particle effect using tsparticles for an engaging background.
‚Äì	Hover Animations: Buttons (e.g., nav buttons, chat button) have animated hover effects with scaling and shadow changes.
‚Ä¢	Color Scheme: Teal (#2dd4bf), navy blue (#1e3a8a), and off-white (#f8fafc) for a professional look.
‚Ä¢	Responsive Design: The UI adapts to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile devices).
5. Scalability and Logging
‚Ä¢	Database: SQLite (faces.db) for storing face encodings, names, and timestamps. Suitable for small-scale applications but can be upgraded to a more robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for larger user bases.
‚Ä¢	Scalability: The backend and Python servers use HTTP and WebSocket protocols, allowing for multiple users. The 1 FPS limit on face recognition ensures performance.
‚Ä¢	Logging:
‚Äì	Backend: Uses winston to log events in logs/backend.log.
‚Äì	Python: Uses Python‚Äôs logging module to log events in logs/python.log.
Assumptions
To meet the hackathon‚Äôs timeline and requirements, the following assumptions were made:
‚Ä¢	Database: SQLite was chosen for simplicity and ease of setup. For production, a more robust database might be needed.
‚Ä¢	LLM: Claude (Anthropic) was used instead of OpenAI due to availability of the API key.
‚Ä¢	Face Recognition Performance: Limited to 1 FPS to balance performance and resource usage.
‚Ä¢	UI Design: A teal, navy blue, and off-white color scheme was selected for a professional and modern look.
‚Ä¢	Live Recognition Output: Hardcoded to ‚ÄúWelcome Barath‚Äù as per the latest requirements, bypassing actual recognition logic for demo purposes.
